"""
Feature Engineering for Churn Prediction
=========================================

Creates derived features from raw customer data.

WHY: Raw features rarely capture business patterns directly.
- tenure=24 is less useful than tenure_group="12-24" (mid-loyalty)
- MonthlyCharges alone misses that high-spend seniors churn more

KEY RULES:
1. Features here use ONLY row-level data (no global stats)
   → Safe to compute BEFORE train/test split (no data leakage)
2. Global transforms (scaling, encoding) happen in the preprocessor
   AFTER the split

INTERVIEW INSIGHT: "Walk me through your feature engineering."
Answer: "We create domain-specific features like tenure groups,
service counts, and charge ratios. These capture customer behavior
patterns that raw features miss. Importantly, these are row-level
transforms computed before the split, while global transforms like
scaling happen after the split to prevent data leakage."
